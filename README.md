# Diffcessible: An accessible diff viewer

Diffcessible is an terminal based diff viewer with an emphasis on being accessible. Our goal is to build a diff viewer on top of Git diff that is accessible to screen readers.

## Overview

The following describes the structure of the project:

`bin/`: The bin directory contains the main entry point for the application and contains the implementation for the command-line interface.
`lib/`: The lib directory contains the main logic for the diff viewer. It is responsible for parsing the diff and displaying it in the terminal.
`test/`: The test directory contains the test suite for the project.
`vendor/`: The vendor directory contains the vendored dependencies for the project.

## Setup Dependencies

To set up the project, please fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. You will need to have `opam` installed to install the dependencies. Once you have `opam` installed, you can run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
```

## Running the Project

To run the project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
dune exec diffcessible [path/to/file1]
```
