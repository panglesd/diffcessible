# Contributing to Diffcessible

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Diffcessible! This guide outlines how to contribute to the project effectively and make the most out of your collaboration experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up the Project:** Make sure you have forked the repository and set up the project on your local machine. Follow the installation instructions in the README.md file.

2. **Understand the Code:** Spend some time getting familiar with the codebase. It's important to have a good grasp of how the project is structured before starting to contribute.

## Claiming an Issue

- **Find an Issue:** Start with "good first issues" to find tasks suitable for newcomers.
- **Claim an Issue:** To avoid duplicate efforts, you need to be assigned to an issue before working on it. To be assigned:
  - Ensure you can build the project successfully.
  - Comment on the issue thread with a screenshot showing the `--help` page of the project on your computer.
  - Ask to be assigned to the issue.
- **Getting Help:** If you need further guidance on the issue you're working on, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help!

## Asking for Help

Encountering challenges is a normal part of the process. If you need help:

- **General OCaml and Tooling Help:** Join our Discord server or visit the OCaml Discuss forum. Look for the "#outreachy" and "#beginner" channels on Discord for guidance.
- \*Project-Specific Help:\*\* Feel free to ask for help within the GitHub issue threads or on our communication channels.

## Contributing Guidelines

- **Code Quality:** Write clean, understandable, and maintainable code. Follow the coding standards and conventions of the project.
- **Commit Messages:** Use concise and descriptive commit messages. This helps with the project's history and review process.
- **Pull Requests:** Before submitting a pull request, make sure your code complies with the project's standards and passes all tests.

## Contributing and AI

While AI tools can be helpful, we encourage contributors to use them wisely. Rely on your understanding and critical thinking:

- **AI Assistance:** Use AI as a learning tool, not as a crutch. Ensure any code generated by AI is thoroughly reviewed and understood before submission.
- **Original Contributions:** We aim for contributions to reflect personal effort and understanding. Directly copying AI-generated code without comprehension is discouraged.

## Conclusion

Thank you for contributing to Diffcessible!
