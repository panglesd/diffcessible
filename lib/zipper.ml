(** The type of a zipper for elements of type ['a]. It consists of three parts:
    - [before]: The list of elements before the current focus.
    - [focus]: The current focused element of the zipper.
    - [after]: The list of elements after the focus.
    - [total_length]: The total length of the list represented by the zipper.
    - [current_index]: The current index (0-based) of the focus in the list. *)
